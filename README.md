# DevSecOps-TaskManager: DevOps Lifecycle Implementation with Security Integration

## Overview
**DevSecOps-TaskManager** is a comprehensive learning project that demonstrates the complete **DevOps lifecycle** through a **Node.js (Express) Task Manager API**. This project showcases how to implement DevOps practices while integrating security (DevSecOps) across all stages of the software development lifecycle.

## 🔒 DevSecOps Integration

While implementing the DevOps lifecycle, this project also demonstrates **DevSecOps** principles:

- **Security in Planning**: Threat modeling and security requirements
- **Secure Coding**: Input validation, authentication, and authorization
- **Secure Building**: Container security scanning with Trivy
- **Security Testing**: SAST with SonarQube, vulnerability scanning
- **Secure Deployment**: Secrets management, secure configurations
- **Security Monitoring**: Security metrics and incident response

### **Core Application**
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt
- **Validation**: Zod schemas
- **Testing**: Jest with Supertest

### **DevOps Tools**
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions + Jenkins
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + SonarQube
- **Security**: Trivy vulnerability scanner
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Cloud**: Azure deployment

### **Development Tools**

## 📌 Observations & Learnings

When starting this project, I approached it mainly from a **DevSecOps mindset**, focusing heavily on security.  
However, as I progressed, I realized that:

- **DevOps is a full lifecycle** (plan → code → build → test → release → deploy → operate → monitor), not just CI/CD pipelines.  
- **DevSecOps extends DevOps** by embedding security across all stages, but DevOps itself also emphasizes collaboration, automation, and monitoring.  
- Automation is important, but so is **team culture** and **continuous feedback loops**.  
- Observability (logs, monitoring, alerts) is just as essential as testing and security.  
- CI/CD pipelines are the backbone — in this project, I implemented CI (linting, migrations, tests, coverage reports) and can extend into CD (deployment).  

This project is therefore both a **DevOps learning journey** and a **DevSecOps practice project**, combining security awareness with the broader DevOps lifecycle.

### **Key DevOps Principles Demonstrated:**
- **Collaboration**: Cross-functional team practices
- **Automation**: Automated testing, building, and deployment
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated code quality checks
- **Continuous Delivery**: Ready-to-deploy artifacts
- **Monitoring**: Application and infrastructure observability
- **Feedback Loops**: Continuous improvement based on metrics

### **DevSecOps Security Integration:**
- **Shift Left Security**: Security considerations from the planning phase
- **Security as Code**: Infrastructure and configuration as code
- **Automated Security Testing**: SAST, vulnerability scanning
- **Security Monitoring**: Real-time security metrics and alerts
